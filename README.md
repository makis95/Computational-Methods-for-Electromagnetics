# Computational-Methods-for-Electromagnetics
Implementation of computetional methods in matlab : Methods of moments, Finite Differences, RandomWalk.

1)Finite Differences can be executed immidiately

2)Methods of Moments must be in the same folder with panels.txt

3)randomwalk.m needs to be in the same folder with conductor1/2/3.txt and gauss1/2/3.txt and random_walk.m needs surface.txt and gauss.txt
